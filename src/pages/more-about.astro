        <li>
            INTJ-A Myers-Briggs: Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging, and Assertive. I think this description is a
            solid one.
        </li>
        <li>
            5-3-1 Enneagram: Investigator, Achiever, and Perfectionist. "Remarkably efficient, hard-working and
            competent, although a little bit anal. While sometimes self-righteous and impatient with others, they are
            pragmatic and tactful enough not to compromise their goals by being too inflexible. Can be clever,
            self-confident, perfectionist, arrogant and glacial." Yikes.
